## Suggestions for Contributions

(Before start to contribute you **must** read the [FAQ](https://www.redox-os.org/faq/) and the [Book](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/))

You can contribute to Redox documentation/code on these repositories:

(The order is based on difficulty, easy things first)

- [Website](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/website)
- [Book](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/book)
- [Main Repository (build system/config)](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox)
- [Cookbook (all system components/ported software)](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/cookbook)
- [Redox C Library](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/relibc)
- [Drivers](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/drivers)
- [Kernel](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/kernel)

### Important Places to Contribute

If you're not fluent in Rust:

 - Write documentation
 - Use/test Redox, filing issues for bugs and needed features (verify the GitLab issues before)
 - Web development ([Redox website](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/website))
 - Write unit tests (may require minimal knowledge of Rust)

If you are fluent in Rust, but not OS Development:

 - Port applications written in Rust to Redox (missing support on relibc will make patches dirty)
 - Rewritten-in-Rust libc ([relibc](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/relibc))
 - Shell ([Ion](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/ion))
 - Package Manager ([pkgutils](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/pkgutils))

If you are fluent in Rust, and have experience with OS Dev:

 - Familiarize yourself with the repository and codebase
 - Grep for `TODO`, `FIXME`, `BUG`, `UNOPTIMIZED`, `REWRITEME`, `DOCME`, and `PRETTYFYME` and fix the code you find
 - Update older code to remove warnings
 - Improve and optimize code, especially in the kernel
 - Write drivers

For those who want to contribute to the Redox GUI, our GUI strategy has recently changed.

 - OrbTk is now sunsetting, and its developers have moved to other projects such as the ones below. There is currently no Redox-specific GUI development underway.
 - Redox is in the process of adopting other Rust-lang GUIs such as [Iced](https://iced.rs) and [Slint](https://slint-ui.com/). Please check out those projects if this is your area of interest.

## Tracking Issues

- [Missing POSIX APIs in relibc](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/relibc/-/issues/173) - high-priority
- [Recipes with old config format](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/cookbook/-/issues/174) - medium-priority

## Build System

You can find the Redox build system organization and commands on this page:

- [Build System Quick Reference](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch08-06-build-system-reference.html)

## Best Practices and Guidelines

- [Best Practices](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch11-00-best-practices.html)

## Style Guidelines

### Rust

Since **Rust** is a relatively small and new language compared to others like _C_, there's really only one standard. Just follow the official Rust standards for formatting, and maybe run `rustfmt` on your changes, until we setup the CI system to do it automatically.

### Git

Please follow our [Git style for pull requests](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch12-04-creating-proper-pull-requests.html).

## GitLab

### Issues

You will need to have a Redox GitLab account to file an issue, and registration can take a few days.

- [Redox Book Guide](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch12-05-issues.html)

### Pull Requests

Please follow our process for [creating proper pull requests](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch12-04-creating-proper-pull-requests.html).

## Other Ways to Contribute

If you're not big on coding, but you still want to help keep the project going, you can still contribute/support in a variety of ways! We'll try to find a way to use anything you have to offer. 

### Design

If you're a good designer, whether it's _2D graphics, 3D graphics, interfaces, web design, you can help. We need logos, UI design, UI skins, app icons, desktop backgrounds, etc_. More information to come on this in the future, for now just join the [Chat](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/ch13-01-chat.html) and ask about graphic design.

### Donate to Redox
